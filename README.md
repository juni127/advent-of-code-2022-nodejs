# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in NodeJS
As the repo name implies, these are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). These solutions were tested agains the input provided for me by the oficial page using the NodeJS v18.16.0 interpreter. Please, do feel free to sugest improvements to the code!

## Folder Structure
The exercises are organized inside folders following this convention:  `./day<day number>/ex<ex number>/solution.js`. Each day imput must be placed under the folder for their correspondent day in a file named `input` with no `\n` at the end of the file, ex.: the first day imput must be placed at `./day1/input`.
